## Section 4.2 Divisibility & the Euclidean Algorithm

__definition__: For integers $a$ and $b$, we say $a$ divides $b$, if $\exists k in \mathbb Z$ such that,

$$
    b = a \cdot k
$$

this is denoted $a \mid b$. In this case we can say $a$ is a __divisor__ or __factor__ of $b$. We can also say $b$ is __divisible__ by $a$.

If $a$ _is not_ a divisor of $b$, then we write,

$$
    a \nmid b
$$

Alternatively,

$$
    a \mid b \iff \frac{b}{a} \in \mathbb Z
$$

#### Example

$$ %Aligned
\begin{aligned}
    3 &\mid 12 &\text{since } 12 = 3(4) \newline
    7 &\mid 7  &\text{since } 7 = 7(1) \newline
    -5 &\mid 5 &\text{since } -5 = 5(-1) \newline
\end{aligned}
$$

#### Facts

For any integer $n$,

* $n \mid 0 $ since $0 = n(0)$
* $0 \nmid n$ since $\not\exists k$ such that $0 = nk$

#### Proposition

Let $a,b,c \in \mathbb Z$. If $a \mid b$ and $b \mid c$ then $a \mid c$.

##### Proof

Since $a \mid b$, then $\exists k \in \mathbb Z$ such that $b = ak$. Likewise, since $b \mid c$, $\exists m \in \mathbb Z$ such that $c = bm$. So,

$$
    c = bm = (ak)m = a(km)
$$

and $km \in \mathbb Z$ since the integers are closed under multiplication. Therefore, since $c = a(km)$, $a \mid c$.

#### Proposition 1

Let $a,b \in \mathbb Z$. If $a \mid b$ and $a \mid c$ the we can say,

$$
    a \mid (bx + cy)
$$

for _any_ $x,y \in \mathbb Z$.

##### Proof

Since $a \mid b$, $\exists k \in \mathbb Z$ such that $b = ak$ and since $a \mid c$, $\exists m \in \mathbb Z$ such that $c = am$. Let $x,y \in \mathbb Z$,

$$ %Aligned
\begin{aligned}
    bx + cy &= (ak)x + (am)y \newline
    &= a(kx) + a(my) \newline
    &= a(kx + my) \newline
\end{aligned}
$$

since the integers are close under addition and multiplication, $kx + my \in \mathbb Z$. Therefore $a \mid bx + cy$.

### Common Divisors

_definition_: Let $a$ and $b$ be integers, such that they are not both zero. Then $g$ is the __greatest common divisor__ of $a$ and $b$ if,

1. $g \mid a$ and $g \mid b$ ("common divisor")
2. if $c$ is also a common divisor, $g \ge c$ ("greatest")

and we write $g = \gcd(a,b)$

#### Example

Find $\gcd(6,15)$.

##### Solution

List the divisors,

* $6: 1,2,3,6$
* $15: 1,3,5,15$

So $\gcd(6,15) = 3$

#### Facts

For any integer $a$,

* $\gcd(a,0) = |a|$
* $\gcd(a,1) = 1$
* If $a \mid b$, then $\gcd(a,b) = |a|$

#### Proposition 2

If $a,b \in \mathbb Z$, not both zero, and $a = bq + r$ (for some $q,r \in \mathbb Z$) then $\gcd(a,b) = \gcd(b,r)$.

##### Proof

> We'll show that $\gcd(a,b) \le \gcd(b,r)$ and $\gcd(b,r) \le \gcd(b,r)$

We know, $\gcd(a,b) \mid a$ and $\gcd(a,b) | b$ so we can say,

$$
    \gcd(a,b) \mid ax + by
$$

and we'll let $x = 1$ and $y = -q$,

$$ %Aligned
\begin{aligned}
    \gcd(a,b) &\mid a + b(-q) \newline
\end{aligned}
$$

note that $r = a - bq$, so,

$$
    \gcd(a,b) \mid r
$$

> So right now we know $\gcd(a,b) \le \gcd(b,r)$

We also know $\gcd(b,r) \mid b$ and $\gcd(b,r) \mid r$ so,

$$
    \gcd(b,r) \mid qb + 1r
$$

since $qb + r = a$,

$$
    \gcd(b,r) \mid a
$$

$$
    \therefore \gcd(b,r) \le \gcd(b,a)
$$

and $\gcd(a,b) = \gcd(b,r)$.
