### Arithmetic Sequence

_definition:_ The __Arithmetic Sequence__ with the first term $a$ and the __common difference__ $d$ is defined recursively as,

$$\begin{aligned}
    a_0 &= a \newline
    a_n &= a_{n-1} + d \newline
\end{aligned}$$

The closed form is,

$$\begin{aligned}
    a_n = a + nd
\end{aligned}$$

for all $n \ge 0$.

### Geometric Sequence

_definition:_ The __Geometric Sequence__ with first term $a$ and __common ratio__ $r$ is recursively defined by,

$$\begin{aligned}
    a_0 &= a \newline
    a_n &= r \cdot a_{n-1} \newline
\end{aligned}$$
