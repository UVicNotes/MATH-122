## Why Math 122?

It's thought in elementary school that everything builds up to calculus. This ignores a bunch of things like Analysis, Algebra and Combinatorics.

### Foundations

We're going to look at:

* Sets
* Relations
* Functions

#### Example

> * Socrates is a man  
> * All men are mortal  
> Is socrates Mortal?

__Solution__: Yes. Socrates is mortal.

## Chapter 0.1: Compound Statements

_definition_: A __statement__ or __proposition__ has a truth value.

#### Examples

If we denote our statement as `p`.

```
p = "7 is a prime number"
```

In this case `p = true`.

```
q = "The square root of 2 is an integer"
```

In this case `q = false`.

```
r = "Every positive integer except two is the sum of two primes"

e.g.

6 = 3 + 3
10 = 3 + 7

```

This statement is unknown and is an outstanding question in mathematics.

#### _Non_ Examples

```
"Is 187698736 prime?"
```

This is a _question_ not a statement.

```
"If n is even"
```

This is a _condition_ not a statement.

---

_definition_: A __compound statement__ is formed by combining multiple statements.

### Conjunction

Let $p$ and $q$ be statements. The conjunction of $p$ and $q$ is written:

$$ p \wedge q $$

#### Truth Table

| $p$   | $q$   | $ p \wedge q $ |
|-------|-------|----------------|
| True  | True  | True           |
| True  | False | False          |
| False | True  | False          |
| False | False | False          |

### Disjunction

Let $p$ and $q$ be statements. The disjunction[^math-inclusive-or] of $p$ and $q$ is written:
[^math-inclusive-or]: In mathematics or is always inclusive.

$$ p \vee q $$

#### Truth Table

| $p$   | $q$   | $ p \vee q $ |
|-------|-------|----------------|
| True  | True  | True           |
| True  | False | True           |
| False | True  | True           |
| False | False | False          |

### Implication

Let $p$ and $q$ be statements. The implication of $p$ to $q$ is written:

$$ p \rightarrow q $$

This implies a `if p then q` relationship.

#### Truth Table

| $p$   | $q$   | $ p \rightarrow q $ |
|-------|-------|----------------|
| True  | True  | True           |
| True  | False | False          |
| False | True  | True           |
| False | False | True           |
