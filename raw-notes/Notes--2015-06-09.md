## Section 3.1 Continued

### Function Equality

_definition_: Two functions $f$ and $g$ are equal if:

* They have the same target
* They have the same domain
* $f(x) = g(x)$ for all $x$ in the domain of $f$

#### Example

Let $f: \mathbb R \mapsto \mathbb Z$ defined by,

$$
    f(x) = \lfloor x \rfloor
$$

and let $g: \mathbb Z \mapsto \mathbb Z$ defined by,

$$
    g(x) = \lfloor x \rfloor
$$

and let $h: \mathbb Z \mapsto \mathbb R$ defined by,

$$
    h(x) = \lfloor x \rfloor
$$

##### Solution

$f \neq g$ since they have different domains but the range of $h$ is equal to the range of $g$. However since they have different targets $h \neq g$.

### Special Functions

_definition_: For any set $A$ the __identity function__, $i_A: A \mapsto A$, where,

$$
    i_A (x) = x, \forall x \in A
$$

we can also say this is the set of ordered pairs, $i_A = \{ (a,a):  a \in A \}

_definition_: The __absolute value__ of $x$, $|x|$ is defined as,

$$
   \left|x\right| = \left\{
     \begin{array}{lr}
       x & \text{ if } x \ge 0 \newline
       -x & \text{ if } x \lt 0 \newline
     \end{array}
   \right.
$$

## Section 3.2 - Inverses and Compositions

#### Example

$$
\begin{aligned}
    A &= \{ 1,2,3,4 \} \newline
    B &= \{ w,x,y,z \} \newline
    C &= \{ a,b,c \} \newline
\end{aligned}
$$

Let $f: A \mapsto B$,

$$
\begin{aligned}
    f = \{ (1,x),(2,y),(3,z),(4,w) \}
\end{aligned}
$$

and,

$$
\begin{aligned}
    g = \{ (1,a),(2,b),(3,c),(4,c) \}
\end{aligned}
$$

#### Solution

$f$ is one-to-one and onto since every element in $B$ is related to exactly one element in $A$, it is therefore a bijection. $g$ is not one-to-one since both $3$ and $4$ map to $c$ but it is onto since every element in $C$ is mapped to.

Reversing the order of each pair in $f$ gives its inverse $f^{-1}: B \mapsto A$, where,

$$
\begin{aligned}
    f^{-1} = \{ (x,1),(y,2),(z,3),(w,4) \}
\end{aligned}
$$

$g$ does not have an inverse since it wouldn't be a function.

### Inverses

_definition_: A function $f: A \mapsto B$ has an __inverse__,

$$
    f^{-1}: B \mapsto A
$$

if and only if the relation obtained by reversing $f$'s ordered pairs is a function and is defined by,

$$
    f^{-1} = \{(y,x): (x,y) \in f \}.
$$

To find the inverse,

1. Switch $x$ and $y$,
2. Solve for $y$.

#### Example

Find $f^{-1}: \mathbb R \setminus \{ 1\} \mapsto \mathbb R \setminus \{2\}$ where,

$$
    f(x) = y =\frac{2x}{x-1}
$$

##### Solution


$$
\begin{aligned}
    \frac{2y}{y-1} &= x \newline
    2y &= x (y-1) \newline
    2y - xy &= -x \newline
    y(2-x) &= -x \newline
    y &= \frac{-x}{2-x} \newline
    y &= \frac{x}{x-2} \newline
\end{aligned}
$$  

#### Proposition

A function $f$ has an inverse if and only if $f$ is a bijection (it's one-to-one and onto).

##### Fact

$$
    (f^{-1})^{-1} = f
$$

So every inverse is a bijection as well.

### Compositions

_definition_: The __composition__ of $g: B \mapsto C$ with $f: A \mapsto B$ is,

$$
    g \circ f = g(f(x)), \forall x \in A
$$
